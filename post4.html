                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <p>All over recent media has been two global super powers advertsising the deployment of hypsersonic weapons, with one noticable absence - the United States. Russia and China have both been open about their operational hypersonics, which has lead many to question: "Does the US have an answer?" The short answer is yes, but it might not be in the form you think.</p>
                        <p>First off, what are hypersonic weapons?</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/scram_missle.jpg" alt="SCRAM jet powered concept vehicle"></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Raytheon-Northrop Grumman's SCRAM jet powered concept vehicle</span>
                        <p>For a weapon to be hypersonic, it has to be capable of max speeds of upwards of Mach 5, or 5 times the speed of sound. However, intercontinental ballistic missiles have been going well beyond mach 5 at unclassified speeds of upwards of mach 20 in low orbit, so what makes the eastern powers' weapons unique?</p>
                        <p>Modern hypersonic weapons boast manuverability at speeds pushing mach 6, meaning standard missle defense systems would have a much harder time defending against these weapons as opposed to traditional ballistic weapons that follow a fixed trajectory after launch. Modern missle defense systems trace the trajectory of the missle and launch another missle or aircraft to intercept the ballistic weapon mid-flight. Manuverable hypersonics could easily avoid this type of defense, making it all but impossible to intercept.</p>
                        <p>Now we arrive to our initial question - with China and Russia boasting operational hypersonics, does the US have an answer? There is a longer answer.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Mutually Assured Destruction - The Nuclear Standoff</h2>
                        <p>The US isn't aggresively pursuing hypersonics because it doesn't see the need to. As capable as modern missile defense systems are, no system can defend against an all out assault. Hypersonic weapons would not give the US any greater advantage over our adversaries than what we already have, and what we have is the concept of mutually assured destruction. As bleak as that concept may sound, it has assured that the first nuclear weapons to be deployed in wartime were also the last.</p>
                        <p>Nuclear weapons are without a doubt the most destructive devices ever created by man, with a single modern nuclear warhead capable of turning a capital city into a crater. With the size of an arsenal like the US, Russia, and China all have, this means they are all capable of crippling another country within an hour or two. So what's stopping them? Well, the big guns are pointed at each other. Were one nation to launch an all out nuclear assault, the other nations would follow suite and it would mean the end for both nations.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">"Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds." -J Robert Oppenheimer, lead scientist of the Manhattan Project</blockquote>
                        <p>It is the knowledge that the use of these weapons will result in the aggressor nation's destruction that keeps the use of them at bay. The very existence of such weapons is the reason not to use them.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Hypersonic Anti-Ship weapons</h2>
                        <p>China's advertised hypersonics are not all nuclear weapons, in fact most of them have coastal defense implications. China's publicized defense strategy is mainly focused on defending their waters. A large piece of this is their anti-ship hypersonics, which boast 4 digit ranges. </p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/glide_vehicle.jpg" alt="Hypersonic boost glide vehicle concept"></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Hypersonic boost glide vehicle concept, similar to China's advertised hypersonic anti-ship weapons</span>
                        <p>The United States's defense is focused less around their waters and more around their skies and ground, and are thus less interested in developing similar weapons.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion and Further Analysis</h2>
                        <p>Whether hypersonic in the modern sense or an ICBM, the nuclear balance of world powers remains just that - a balance. Any nuclear weapon poses a threat to another nation, but with a response just as threatening and destructive, the plain existence of such weapons becomes a nation's defense.</p>
                        <p>While the US has multiple hypersonic weapon programs in development, priority is being given to other defense projects like next gen aircraft and airborn munitions.</p>
