                    <p>The B-21 Raider was revealed with all the pomp and circumstance it deserved at Northrop Grumman's
                        Plant 42, ushering in a new age of military and aviation technology. The product of more than 40
                        years of progress in stealth aviation, the B-21 Raider, named for the infamous Doolittle
                        raiders, will be the hardest aircraft to detect on radar folllowing its only stealth bomber
                        predecesor, the B-2 Spirit. </p>
                    <p>The airframe displayed at the reveal was an empty shell, as many of the avionics and other
                        components are still in development. Consequentially, the groundbreaking aircraft has yet to
                        take its first flight, but is scheduled to do so in late 2023. </p>
                    <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/B21_main_rollout.jpg" alt="B-21 Reveal" /></a>
                    <p>What was most significant about the reveal was what Secratary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III had
                        to say. Being purposefully vague, the Secratary of Defense spoke on each aspect of the aircrafts
                        capabilities, boasting not any numbers of benchmarks, but promises to our adversaries of what
                        this aircraft could do. </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Secratary of Defense comments</h2>
                    <p>Perhaps the most shocking of all the Secratary of Defense's comments came as he commented on the
                        projected range of the aircraft. He is quoted for saying No other long-range bomber can match
                        its efficiency. It won’t need to be based in-theater, and it won’t need logistical support to
                        hold any target at risk," hinting at the idea that the B-21 will not need to air refuel to reach
                        global targets. </p>

                            alt="B-21 Raider at Plant 42" /></a>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">"No other long-range bomber can match its efficiency. It won’t need
                        to be based in-theater, and it won’t need logistical support to hold any target at risk" -The
                        Honorable Lloyd J. Austin III </blockquote>
                    <p> Among other comments, he said “The B-21 looks imposing, but what’s under the frame and the
                        space-age coatings is even more impressive... Even the most sophisticated air defense systems
                        will struggle to detect the B-21 in the sky.” While specific numbers remain and will continue to
                        remain classified, what has been revealed no doubt caused restless nights for adversaries who
                        were no doubt tuned into the unveiling. To learn more about the B-21 and its unveiling, visit

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Future of America's Bomber Fleet</h2>
                    <p>Naturally, questions may arise about America's current fleet of heavy payload and long range
                        strike bombers. The B-52 Stratofortress for example has been in service in one variant or
                        another since the Vietnam War, and the B-1B Lancer since the Cold War. Surprisingly, it's the
                        B-1 or "BONE" that finds itself on the future chopping block, with the B-21 slated to fly
                        alongside B-52's into the 2050's.

                        Lancer</span>
                    <p>The B-2 Spirit, to which the B-21 bears a striking resemblance, will also eventually be replaced
                        by the B-21, which promises to fly the Spirit's mission better and cheaper. </p>
                    <p>The retirement of these powerful and effective bombers won't happen immediately however, as the
                        B-21 isn't slated to enter service for another few years, and it will take even longer after
                        that for the first of these aircraft to make their way to the boneyard. </p>
